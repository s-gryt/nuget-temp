# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NuGet Package Dependency Visualizer is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides interactive visualization of NuGet package dependencies and vulnerabilities for .NET projects. The extension uses React and force-graph-3d to create interactive 3D dependency graphs, allowing developers to understand their project's dependency structure and identify security vulnerabilities at a glance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want to visualize my project's NuGet package dependencies in an interactive graph, so that I can understand the dependency structure and relationships between packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a .csproj file THEN the extension SHALL display a context menu option "Visualize NuGet Dependencies"
2. WHEN I select the visualization option THEN the extension SHALL parse the project file and display an interactive 3D force-directed graph
3. WHEN the graph is displayed THEN each node SHALL represent a NuGet package with distinct colors for different packages
4. WHEN the graph is displayed THEN each edge SHALL represent a dependency relationship between packages
5. WHEN I hover over a node THEN the extension SHALL display package information including name and version
6. WHEN I click on a node THEN the extension SHALL highlight the node and its direct dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want to identify vulnerable NuGet packages in my project, so that I can prioritize security updates and maintain secure applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "Visualize NuGet Vulnerabilities" from the context menu THEN the extension SHALL scan for package vulnerabilities
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN vulnerable packages SHALL be highlighted with severity-based colors (critical: dark red, high: red, medium: orange, low: yellow)
3. WHEN no vulnerabilities are found THEN packages SHALL be displayed in neutral colors
4. WHEN I hover over a vulnerable package THEN the extension SHALL display vulnerability details including severity level and description
5. WHEN vulnerability scanning fails THEN the extension SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN the vulnerability scan completes THEN the extension SHALL show a summary of found vulnerabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want to access dependency visualization through multiple entry points, so that I can quickly visualize dependencies from different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a .csproj file in the explorer THEN the extension SHALL show visualization options in the context menu
2. WHEN I open a .csproj file in the editor THEN the extension SHALL show visualization options in the editor title menu
3. WHEN I use the Command Palette THEN the extension SHALL provide commands for "NuGet: Visualize Dependencies" and "NuGet: Visualize Vulnerabilities"
4. WHEN no .NET project is detected THEN the extension SHALL display an informative message
5. WHEN multiple projects exist in the workspace THEN the extension SHALL allow selection of which project to visualize

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want the extension to automatically detect my .NET project structure, so that I don't need to manually configure project settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN it SHALL scan the workspace for .csproj files
2. WHEN PackageReference entries are found THEN the extension SHALL extract package names and versions
3. WHEN the project uses packages.config THEN the extension SHALL parse the XML file for package information
4. WHEN transitive dependencies exist THEN the extension SHALL resolve and include them in the visualization
5. WHEN project files are modified THEN the extension SHALL detect changes and offer to refresh the visualization
6. WHEN the .NET SDK is not available THEN the extension SHALL display a helpful error message with installation instructions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want interactive graph controls, so that I can navigate and explore the dependency graph effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the graph is displayed THEN I SHALL be able to zoom in and out using mouse wheel or touch gestures
2. WHEN I drag on the graph background THEN the camera SHALL pan to show different areas of the graph
3. WHEN I drag a node THEN the node SHALL move and the physics simulation SHALL adjust other nodes accordingly
4. WHEN I double-click on a node THEN the extension SHALL center the view on that node
5. WHEN the graph is large THEN the extension SHALL provide a "Fit to View" button to show all nodes
6. WHEN I right-click on a node THEN the extension SHALL show a context menu with package-specific actions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want the extension to work offline after initial setup, so that I can visualize dependencies without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is first used THEN it SHALL download and cache necessary force-graph libraries locally
2. WHEN working offline THEN dependency visualization SHALL work without internet connection
3. WHEN working offline THEN vulnerability scanning SHALL use cached data if available
4. WHEN cached vulnerability data is stale THEN the extension SHALL notify the user and suggest updating when online
5. WHEN force-graph assets are missing THEN the extension SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want the extension to handle different .NET project types, so that I can use it across various project structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with .NET Core projects THEN the extension SHALL correctly parse PackageReference entries
2. WHEN working with .NET Framework projects THEN the extension SHALL support both PackageReference and packages.config formats
3. WHEN working with .NET 5+ projects THEN the extension SHALL handle modern project file formats
4. WHEN working with solution files THEN the extension SHALL allow visualization of individual projects or the entire solution
5. WHEN TargetFramework affects package resolution THEN the extension SHALL use the appropriate framework context

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a .NET developer, I want comprehensive error handling and user feedback, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the extension SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN dependency parsing fails THEN the extension SHALL provide specific guidance on resolving the issue
3. WHEN the .NET CLI is unavailable THEN the extension SHALL show installation instructions
4. WHEN project files are corrupted THEN the extension SHALL identify the problematic files
5. WHEN vulnerability data cannot be retrieved THEN the extension SHALL explain the limitation and suggest alternatives
6. WHEN the extension is loading data THEN it SHALL show progress indicators and status messages
