# Webview Rendering Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NuGet Dependency Graph extension is successfully analyzing project dependencies and completing the analysis process, but the webview is displaying a blank screen instead of rendering the 3D dependency graph. This critical issue prevents users from visualizing their dependency data despite successful backend processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Webview Content Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview to properly load and display content so that I can see the dependency visualization after analysis completes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension completes dependency analysis THEN the webview SHALL display the 3D graph visualization
2. WHEN the webview loads THEN it SHALL show loading indicators during data processing
3. IF webview content fails to load THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages
4. WHEN webview assets are missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to CDN resources or show appropriate error

### Requirement 2: Asset Loading and Script Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required JavaScript libraries and assets to load properly so that the 3D visualization can render correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview initializes THEN all required React and 3D graphics libraries SHALL load successfully
2. WHEN assets fail to load THEN the system SHALL log specific error messages for debugging
3. WHEN using offline mode THEN bundled assets SHALL be accessible and functional
4. WHEN using online mode THEN CDN fallbacks SHALL work as expected

### Requirement 3: Data Communication Between Extension and Webview

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analyzed dependency data to be properly passed to the webview so that it can be visualized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency analysis completes THEN the graph data SHALL be serialized and passed to webview
2. WHEN webview receives data THEN it SHALL validate the data structure before rendering
3. IF data is malformed THEN the webview SHALL display specific error information
4. WHEN data is empty THEN the webview SHALL show an appropriate "no dependencies" message

### Requirement 4: Console Error Logging and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed error logging so that I can identify and fix webview rendering issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webview errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged to both browser console and VS Code output
2. WHEN assets fail to load THEN specific asset names and error details SHALL be logged
3. WHEN React components fail to render THEN component stack traces SHALL be captured
4. WHEN data parsing fails THEN the malformed data structure SHALL be logged for analysis

### Requirement 5: Content Security Policy Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview to comply with VS Code's security policies while still loading all required resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webview loads THEN all scripts SHALL execute within CSP constraints
2. WHEN using external CDN resources THEN CSP SHALL allow the required domains
3. WHEN using inline scripts THEN they SHALL be properly whitelisted
4. IF CSP blocks resources THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the security restriction

### Requirement 6: Fallback and Error Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want graceful error handling so that I can understand what went wrong when visualization fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 3D libraries fail to load THEN the system SHALL attempt to use 2D fallback visualization
2. WHEN all visualization fails THEN the system SHALL display dependency data in table format
3. WHEN webview crashes THEN the system SHALL provide a reload button and error details
4. WHEN network issues prevent CDN loading THEN offline assets SHALL be used automatically
